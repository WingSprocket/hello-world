# hello-world
This is a hello-world repository. I'm using it to learn how github works. Exciting! Oh boy!
The reason I'm here is that I think it's a very silly idea to go into life this century without a decent understanding of coding and the working of computers. I should have learned all this in high school, but the curriculum in Australia and New Zealand has absolutely not caught up with our changing times. It's like they say: coding is the new literacy. I don't like being illiterate.
